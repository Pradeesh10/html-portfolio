<h1>Pradeesh Reddy's Top 3 Movies </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all-time, one which I can watch thousands of times and still makes me go awe of this movie. The concept itself "Dream within a Dream" is something which is unheard of right. The way in which Christoper Nolan managed to do this is absolutely exceptional. Every set-pieces was top-notch especially you will come across a scene in which a part of a road kind of folds. It will keep you in your seats till the very last. One which y'all should surely watch and I'm sure it will leave a long lasting impact on you.</p>
<h3>Vikram</h3>
<p>This Tamil Action-flick served to be a proper comeback for Ulaganayagan KamalHaasan. It was hyped and boy did it live upto that. All the top guns like KamalHaasan, Fahaadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi did an amazing job when it comes to portraying their characters. Anirudh once again served a bombastic bgm which had become quite a norm for him then. A massive credit should go to Director Lokesh Kanagaraj for pulling this off. When you're making a film which includes such an ensemble-cast, you need to make sure that every actor/actoress is getting proper screen-space and each of their character is properly weighted. All the action set-pieces were wonderful and the way people were screaming thier lungs-out throughout the movie at the theatre was something which I'll never forget for good reason.</p>
<h3>Ghillie</h3>
<p>My very first film. One which made me a hardcore fan of Thalapathy Vijay. This movie is a remake of Telugu Movie Okkadu. I've seen both the versions and gota say that Tamil Version was better. This movie has everything in it, you name it. Comedy scenes, Action, Emotions, Good Music. This movie is the one which kind of led to start of stardom of Vijay. Other Artists such as Trisha, Prakash Raj, Ashish Vidyarthi played a massive part too in this movie. A must watch for everyone and I'm sure you would love it.</p>
